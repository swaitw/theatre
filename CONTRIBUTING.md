# Contributing to Theatre.js

## Development workflow

### Setting up the environment

Make sure you have [`node 14+`](https://nodejs.org/) installed:

```sh
$ node -v
> v14.0.0
```

and [`yarn 1.22+`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/):

```sh
$ yarn -v
> 1.22.10
```

Then clone the repo:

```sh
# for SSH:
$ git clone git@github.com:<github-username>/theatre.git
# for HTTPS:
$ git clone https://github.com/<github-username>/theatre.git

$ cd theatre
```

And fetch the dependencies with yarn:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn postinstall
```

- Notes about Yarn:
  - This project uses [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces)
    so `npm install` will not work.
  - This repo uses Yarn v2. You don't have to install yarn v2 globally. If you
    do have yarn 1.22.10+ on your machine, yarn will automatically switch to v2
    when you `cd` into theatre. Read more about Yarn v2
    [here](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Hacking with `playground`

The quickest way to start tweaking things is to run the `playground` package.

```sh
$ cd ./packages/playground
$ yarn serve
$ yarn cli build
# or, shortcut:
$ cd root
$ yarn playground
```

The playground is a bunch of ready-made projects that you can run to experiment
with Theatre.js. It also contains the project's end-to-end tests.

Read more at
[`./packages/playground/README.md`](./packages/playground/README.md).

### Hacking with `examples/`

Other than `playground`, the [`examples/`](./examples) folder contains a few
small projects that use Theatre.js with [parcel](https://parceljs.org),
[Create react app](create-react-app.dev), and other build tools. This means that
unlike `playground`, you have to build all the packages before running the
examples.

You can do that by running the `build` command at the root of the repo:

```sh
$ yarn cli build
```

Then build any of the examples:

```
$ cd examples/dom-cra
$ yarn start
```

### Running unit/integration tests

We use a single [jest](https://jestjs.io/) setup for the repo. The tests files
have the `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.

You can run the tests at the root of the repo:

```sh
$ yarn test

# or run them in watch mode:
$ yarn test --watch
```

### Running end-to-end tests

End-to-end tests are hosted in the playground package. More details
[there](./packages/playground/README.md).

### Type checking

The packages in this repo have full typescript coverage, so you should be able
to get diagnostics and intellisense if your editor supports typescript.

You can also run a typecheck of the whole repo from the root:

```sh
$ yarn typecheck

# or in watch mode:
$ yarn typecheck --watch
```

- If you're using VSCode, we have a ["Typescript watch"](./.vscode/tasks.json)
  task for VSCode that you can use by
  [running](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks) "Run Task ->
  Typescript watch".
- If you wish to contribute code without typescript annotations, that's totally
  fine. We're happy to add the annotations to your PR.

### Linting

We're using a minimal [ESLint](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks)
setup for linting. If your editor supports ESLint, you should get diagnostics as
you code. You can also run the lint command from the root of the repo:

```sh
$ yarn lint:all
```

Some lint rules have
[autofix](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems),
so you can run:

```sh
$ yarn lint:all --fix
```

### Publishing to npm

Currently all packages (except for [`@theatre/r3f`](./packages/r3f/)) share the
same version number. In order to publish to npm, you can run the `release`
script from the root of the repo:

```sh
$ yarn cli release x.y.z # npm publish version x.y.z
$ yarn cli release x.y.z-dev.w # npm publish version x.y.z-dev.w and tag it as "dev"
$ yarn cli release x.y.z-rc.w # npm publish version x.y.z-rc.w and tag it as "rc"
```

## Project structure

The [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) consists of:

- `@theatre/core` – The core animation library at
  [`./packages/core`](./packages/core).
- `@theatre/studio` – The visual editor at
  [`./packages/studio`](./packages/studio).
- `@theatre/dataverse` – The reactive dataflow library at
  [`./packages/dataverse`](./packages/dataverse).
- `@theatre/react` – Utilities for using Theatre.js with React at
  [`./packages/react`](./packages/react).
- `@theatre/r3f` – The react-three-fiber extension at
  [`./packages/r3f`](./packages/r3f).
- `playground` – The playground explained [above](#hacking-with-playground),
  located at [`./packages/playground`](./packages/playground)
- `examples/` \* A bunch of [examples](#hacking-with-examples) at
  [./examples](./examples).

In addition, each package may contain a `dotEnv/` folder that holds some
dev-related files, like bundle configuration, lint setup, etc.

## Commands

These commands are available at the root workspace:

```sh
# Run the playground. It's a shortcut for `cd ./playground; yarn run serve`
$ yarn playground

# Run all the tests.
$ yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode.
$ yarn test --watch

# Typecheck all the packages
$ yarn typecheck

# Typecheck all the packages in watch mode
$ yarn typecheck --watch

# Run eslint on the repo
$ yarn lint:all

# Run eslint and auto fix
$ yarn lint:all --fix

# Build all the packages
$ yarn cli build

```

> Yarn passes all extra parameters to the internal scripts. So, for example, if
> you wish to run the tests in watch mode, you can run `yarn test --watch`.

## Documentation

The libraries come bundled with typescript definitions with TSDoc comments. You
can explore the API if your editor is configured to display TSDoc comments.

## What to contribute

You can contribute with:

- Bug fixes
- Feature suggestions
- Features implementations
- [Documentation](https://github.com/theatre-js/website/) (or write/record
  tutorials of your own which we'll showcase)
- Create examples projects for your own particular dev stack (eg. using
  Pixie/Vue/THREE.js/Babylon/etc)

ideas.

### Helping with outstanding issues

Feel free to chime in on any
[issue](https://github.com/theatre-js/theatre/issues). We have labeled some with
["Help wanted"](https://github.com/theatre-js/theatre/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
or
["Good first issue"](https://github.com/theatre-js/theatre/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
if you're just getting started with the codebase.

## Sending pull requests

We use Github's regular PR workflow. Basically fork the repo, push your commits,
and send a pull request.

If you're a core contributor and have write access to the repo, you should
submit your pull requests from a branch rather than a personal fork. The naming
convention for these branches should be:

- `(feature|hotfix|docs)/[identifier]` or
- an autogenerated branch name from a Github issue (On an issue without a PR,
  look under the "Development" sidebar heading for a "create a branch link")

Squash & merge should be preferred most of the time to keep the main branch
clean, unless the commit history is relevant, in which case rebase should be
used.

Always update your feature branch with a rebase from the main branch to make
sure that you don't accidentally break main with an undetected conflict.

Branches belonging to merged PRs should be deleted.
