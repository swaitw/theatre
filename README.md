> ✨ Update: Theatre.js 1.0 is around the corner. We have _temporarily_ moved development to a private repo so we can iterate faster. We'll push our work back to this public repo soon. Terms and license will remain OSS, as before. (Also, [we're hiring – join the core team!](https://www.theatrejs.com/join)).

Theatre.js is an animation library for high-fidelity motion graphics. It is
designed to help you express detailed animation, enabling you to create
intricate movement, and convey nuance.

Theatre.js can be used both programmatically _and_ visually.

---

You can use Theatre.js to:

- Animate 3D objects made with THREE.js or other 3D libraries
