         * we get the final value.
         *
         * Notes on performance: This prism _will_ recalculate every time any value of any prop changes,
         * including nested props. In other words, if foo.bar.baz changes, this prism will recalculate. Even more,
         * if boo.bar.baz is sequenced and the sequence is playing, this prism will recalculate on every frame.
         * This might sound inefficient, but we have a few tricks to make it fast:
         *
         * First, on each recalculation, most of the prisms that this prism depends on will not have changed,
         * and so reading them is cheap. For example, if foo.bar.baz changed due to being sequenced, but
         * foo.bar2 hasn't because it is static, reading foo.bar2 will be cheap.
         *
         * Secondly, as we deep merge each layer, we use a cache to avoid recalculating the same merge over and over.
         *
         * Third, we have sorted our layers in the order of how likely they are to change. For example, sequenced
         * values are likely to change on each frame, so they're layerd on last. Static values seldom change,
         * and default values almost never do, so they're layered on first.
         *
         * All of this means that most the work of this prism is done on the very first calculation, and subsequent
         * recalculations are cheap.
         *
         * Question: What about object.initialValue which _could_ change on every frame, but isn't layerd on last?
         * Answer: initialValue is seldom used (it's only used in `@theatre/r3f` as far as we know). So this won't
         * affect the majority of use cases. And in case it _is_ used, it's better for us to implement an alternative
         * to `object.getValues()` that does not layer initialValue (and also skips defaultValue too). This is discussed
         * in issue [P-208](https://linear.app/theatre/issue/P-208/use-overrides-rather-than-final-values-in-r3f).
