 * Studio consistent identifier for identifying any individual item on a sheet

 *
 * See {@link createStudioSheetItemKey}.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This is the kind of type which should not find itself in Project state,
 * due to how it is lossy in the case of additional model layers being introduced.
 * e.g. When we introduce an extra layer of multiple sequences per sheet,
 * all the {@link StudioSheetItemKey}s will have different generated values,
 * because they'll have additional information (the "sequence id"). This means
 * that all data attached to those item keys will become detached.
 *
 * This kind of constraint might be mitigated by a sort of migrations ability,
 * but for the most part it's just going to be easier to try not using
 * {@link StudioSheetItemKey} for any data that needs to stick around after
 * version updates to Theatre.
 *
 * Alternatively, if you did want some kind of universal identifier for any item
 * that can be persisted and survive project model changes, it's probably going
 * to be easier to simply generate a unique id for all items you want to use in
 * this way, and don't do any of this concatenating/JSON.stringify "hashing"
 * stuff.
