  // This is not a quick-start guide, so feel free to skip around.

  // Since this is a test suite, you should be able to run it in [debug mode](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/troubleshooting)

  // We recommend you follow this guide using VSCode's [Jest extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest),

      // our program is going to have one parameter, which is `timeOfDay`, which is a number between 0 and 24.
      // the idea is that as `timeOfDay` changes, our program would render the sun in a different position.

      // Let's express the state of our program as a dataverse `Atom`. An `Atom` basically holds
      // a piece of state, and it can be read from and written to. It also provides a way to listen

      // now, we're going to write a function that renders the image of the sunset.
      // this function is going to be a "reactive function", which means that it's going to
      // re-run whenever any of its dependencies change.
      // in this case, the only dependency is `timeOfDay`, so we're going to use `prism()` to create
      // a reactive function out of it.

        // and `state.pointer.timeOfDay` helps `val()` find only get the value of `timeOfDay` and
        // not the value of the whole state.

        // Okay, we're not _actually_ going to render a piece of ascii art here, although that would have been cool.

      expect(pointerToPrismV2(ptr).getValue()).toBe(0) // the prism works

      // The second improvement would be to decouple `pointerToPrism()` from the implementation of `Atom`.
      // Namely, `pointerToPrism()` only calls `Atom.onChangeByPointer()` and `Atom.getByPointer()`, which
      // are methods that can be implemented on other objects as well. Instead, we can just define an interface
      // that requires these methods to be implemented.
      // We call this interface `PointerToPrismProvider`:
      // For example, Atom implements this interface:

        // one final improvement is to allow the implementation of `PointerToPrismProvider` to create
        // the prism, rather than us calling `prism()`, and `prism.source` directly. This will allow
        // the implementation to custmoize and possibly optimise how the prism sources its value.
