  /**
   * We were initially externalizing react+fiber+drei+stdlib and having them as peer deps. Once we started to test this setup with different
   * versions of each, we realized that:
   *
   * 1. It can be confusing for npm users to satisfy the peer dep ranges. I (Aria) struggled to get the peer deps right in a sample project.
   * 2. More importantly, some permutations of these deps ended up not necessarily working together even though they satisfied the peer dep
   *    ranges.
   * 3. Also, since react 17 and 18 have subtly different behaviors (useEffect, suspend, etc), we thought that us having to support both of
   *    those behaviors in the snapshot editor is probably not that useful to the user. So we thought removing that surface area by bundling
   *    react into the snapshot editor would reduce the chance of running into bugs caused by the differences between react 17 and 18.
   *
   * So we made the call to bundle all of these libraries in the `/extension` bundle.
   *
   * The downsides we thought about:
   *
   * 1. The bundle size of the snapshot editor increases, but since users don't ship the snapshot editor to their end users, we thought this
   *    should be tolerable (let us know if it's not).
   * 2. Another downside we thought of is that having two versions of react and fiber on the same page may cause issues, but we haven't ran
   *   into any yet, so don't know if those issues couldn't be worked around.
