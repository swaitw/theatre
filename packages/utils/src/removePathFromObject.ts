/**
 * Mutates `base` to remove the path `path` from it. And if deleting a key makes
 * its parent object empty of keys, that parent object will be deleted too, and so on.
 *
 * If `path` is `[]`, then `base` it'll remove all props from `base`.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 * removePathFromObject({a: {b: 1, c: 2}}, ['a', 'b']) // base is mutated to: {a: {c: 2}}
 * removePathFromObject({a: {b: 1}}, ['a', 'b']) // base is mutated to: {}, because base.a is now empty.
 * ```
